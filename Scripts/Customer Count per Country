The following script was used to create visuals seen in the Rockbuster Presentation slide 5.

SELECT 	D.country,
	COUNT(customer_id) AS count_of_customers
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY COUNT(customer_id) DESC
