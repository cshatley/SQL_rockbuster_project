The following script was used to create visuals seen in the Rockbuster Presentation slide 7.

SELECT  C.city,
        D.country,
        SUM(E.amount) AS total_revenue
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
INNER JOIN payment E ON A. customer_id = E.customer_id
GROUP BY  C.city, 
          D.country
ORDER BY SUM(E.amount) DESC
