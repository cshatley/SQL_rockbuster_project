The following script was used to create visuals seen in the Rockbuster Presentation slide 6.

SELECT  B.first_name,
        B.last_name,
        E.country,
        SUM(A.amount) AS total_spent
FROM payment A
INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id = E.country_id
GROUP BY  first_name, 
          last_name, 
          country
ORDER BY total_spent DESC
LIMIT 10
